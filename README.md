# HTML-Project-2021
Hi, and welcome to my website! 

In case you didn't know, I am Isabel Lifu, a ninth-grade student. I am highly professional with quality designs and authenticity in my work. This repository is part of my Digital Technology assignment, but feel free to take a look ( •̀ ω •́ )y\


Here's a quick summary of my website:

Index.html - This is the home page of my website, and it has boxed and hyperlinked images that take you to the destination described right below them. When you hover your pointer over the box, its outline changes colour, from light grey to black. This is my own unique design for a stylish homepage, where the links and titles are always in the navigation bar at the top.

News.html - This is where I included a snapshot of one of my English assignments from last year, talking about Australia's constitution. It is the first link on the navigation bar, where it will turn lilac when you hover your mouse over "News". Not only does this page have a series of paragraphs, but also images that are well-positioned into the center and a copyright line at the end, written in the small font. All text I've written visible on my webpages have been styled in customised fonts to make it readable and more classy.

Do_aliens_exist.html - This page is one of my first pages I created, because I began with the idea of investigating extra-terrestrial life existence. It has a highly-engaging design that will surely capture any reader's attention, from its striking images, fancy fonts, use of collums, and awesome design.

Whats_the_HST.html - This page is a snapshot of my Space assignment for Science last year on the Hubble Space Telescope. It's a fascinating piece of technology that explores the universe and beyond. It suits well into my space theme and links to the alien page. Some highlights of this page are: The floating images on the left and right, the padding used to beautifully space out the images, and once again, the work itself. Everything on that page is written by me, meaning nothing has been copied and pasted from the internet. This has been proven by Turnitin last year, where it held a 0% similarity report. STUNNING!


I hope you enjoy my website and have fun! (≧∀≦)ゞ

Yours sincerely, 

Isabel Lifu
